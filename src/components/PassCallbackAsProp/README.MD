You can pass state as props to child components, but you're not limited <br/>
to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's <br/>
defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child <br/>
components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child <br/>
just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method <br />
name under this.props in the child component.
